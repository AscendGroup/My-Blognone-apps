TLDR; Just download My Blognone if you love to enjoy IT news by reading, sharing to your friends. It is free and no advertisement makes you are annoyed.

This is an Unofficial Blognone App. It uses RSS Feed from Blognone.com. I have developed this app because I really love to read IT news and Blognone is one of good sources. In addition to, I want to improve programming skills such as VIPER design pattern integration with Unit Testing, UI Automation, and using fastlane for automation deployment as well. You can see full source code from https://github.com/csnu17/My-Blognone-apps. Feel free to contact me if you have any question or want more features. Happy reading, cheer.
